E1: Git Research
1. git init initializes a new git repository
2. git add stages changed files to be committed while git commit actually commits the changes with a message
3. Staged files are prepared to be committed but not yet locked in and can still be changed. Committed files are now included in the history of the repository
4. git commit -am will add and commit all modified files
5. git reset unstages files, git reset <commit hash> <filename> will revert that file to its state in that commit
6. Commit messages will make searching through the versions looking for a specific change much easier
7. To just look at the previous commit, git checkout <commit hash>, but to revert to that version and remove all subsequent commits, git reset --hard <commit hash>
8. :q will quit vi

E2: GitHub Research
1. git is managed locally while GitHub stores the versions remotely. GitHub cannot exist without git, but git can exist without GitHub
2. GitHub is easy to post open source code, free for public repositories, and very popular for programmers.
3. Git push commits the local repository to the remote repository
4. Git pull fetches and merges from the remote repository. Git fetch just gets the remote repository without altering the local files and git merge changes the local files
